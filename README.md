# SpanShot

> Catch the error. Keep the flow.

## The Problem

Developers waste **10-30 minutes per error** manually:

- Hunting through scattered logs
- Copy-pasting to ChatGPT
- Gathering code context (files, git history, stack traces)
- Reasoning about root causes

With **5-8 errors per day**, this compounds into **hours of lost productivity**.

## The Solution

SpanShot is a **local CLI daemon** that automatically:

1. **Watches** your logs
1. **Detects** errors with temporal context (the "span window" of what happened before/after)
1. **Diagnoses** root causes using AI with full code context
1. **Delivers** actionable fixes through notifications

All **without leaving your terminal**.

## The Impact

**Reduces error diagnosis time from 10-30 minutes to under 1 minute** by automating context gathering and AI analysis, while keeping you in flow state.

- ✅ No cloud backend
- ✅ No signup
- ✅ BYOK (bring your own API key)
- ✅ Open source
- ✅ Privacy-first (local-first, optional local AI)

## Pipeline Vision

```
┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
│   COLLECT    │───▶│   CAPTURE    │───▶│   ANALYZE    │───▶│   DELIVER    │
└──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘

  Unify sources      Span window         Root cause          Notifications
```

| Phase | Purpose | Input | Output | AI Used? |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Collect** | Unify scattered error sources into one stream | Raw logs, stdout, Docker | Normalized event stream | ❌ No |
| **Capture** | Identify errors + capture temporal context (span) | Event stream | Error event + span window | ❌ No |
| **Analyze** | Understand *why* error happened + *how* to fix | Error + span + code context | Diagnosis + solution | ✅ Yes |
| **Deliver** | Present insights without disrupting workflow | Diagnosis | Notification/alert | ❌ No |

**Key Insight:** Capture doesn't just find the error line—it captures a **time-window snapshot** (e.g., 5 seconds before/after) to give AI the full story of what led to the failure.

**Current Status:** Building **Collect + Capture** (v0.1) - AI-free monitoring with deterministic pattern matching.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** Nix with flakes (recommended for consistent dev environment with pre-configured tooling) or GHC 9.12.2+ and Cabal 3.10+

```bash
# Enter development environment (Nix)
nix develop

# Build
just build

# Run tests
just test

# Install
cabal install
```

## Quick Start

### Current (v0.1 - Collection Only)

```bash
# Tail a log file and stream as JSONL
spanshot collect --logfile /var/log/app.log

# Filter errors with jq
spanshot collect --logfile app.log | jq 'select(.line | contains("ERROR"))'
```

### Coming Soon (v0.1 - Capture)

```bash
# Capture errors with temporal context
spanshot capture --logfile app.log --regex-pattern "ERROR" --pre-window 5 --post-window 5

# Run full pipeline (collect + capture)
spanshot run --logfile app.log --regex-pattern "ERROR|FATAL"
```

## Output Format

### Collection Events (Current)

Each line is a JSON event:

```json
{"source":"./app.log","session_order_id":0,"read_at_utc":"2025-10-15T16:32:05.123456Z","line":"[INFO] Application started"}
```

**Fields:**

- `source`: Log file path
- `session_order_id`: Sequential counter (resets per run)
- `read_at_utc`: UTC timestamp when event was read
- `line`: Raw line content (no trailing newline)

### Span Snapshots (Coming Soon)

```json
{
  "error_event": {
    "source": "./app.log",
    "session_order_id": 42,
    "read_at_utc": "2025-10-15T16:32:15.123Z",
    "line": "ERROR: Database connection failed"
  },
  "pre_window": [
    {"line": "INFO: Connecting to database..."},
    {"line": "INFO: Retrying connection..."}
  ],
  "post_window": [
    {"line": "WARN: Falling back to cache"},
    {"line": "INFO: Request completed with degraded service"}
  ],
  "detected_by": [
    {"pattern": "ERROR"}
  ],
  "captured_at_utc": "2025-10-15T16:32:20.456Z"
}
```

## Current Limitations (v0.1)

**Scope:**

- ❌ Single file only (no Docker logs, stdout, multiple sources yet)
- ❌ No log rotation handling
- ❌ Line-based parsing (multi-line stack traces split into separate events)
- ❌ No structured field extraction from JSON/logfmt logs
- ❌ In-memory state only (no persistence)

**Capture (in progress):**

- ❌ Regex patterns only (no keyword or log-level detectors yet)
- ❌ No YAML configuration file support yet (CLI flags only)

**Not Yet Built:**

- ❌ Analyze phase (AI diagnosis)
- ❌ Deliver phase (notifications)

## Development

```bash
# Run all tests
just test

# Run specific test suite
just test-unit
just test-integration-cli

# Build
just build
```

See [`justfile`](justfile) for all available commands.

## Testing

The project includes two test suites:

1. **Unit tests** - Test core library functionality (streaming, event generation, error detection)
1. **CLI integration tests** - End-to-end validation of the compiled binary, including JSONL output format and error handling

Run with `just test` or `cabal test`.

## Architecture

SpanShot is designed as a modular pipeline with distinct phases:

- **Collect** (`src/Collect.hs`): Stream log files, normalize to JSONL events
- **Capture** (`src/Capture.hs`): Detect errors, capture temporal span windows *(in progress)*
- **Analyze**: AI-powered root cause diagnosis *(planned)*
- **Deliver**: Notification and alert delivery *(planned)*

**Current Implementation:**

- **Library** (`src/`): Collect (complete), Capture (in progress)
- **Executable** (`app/`): CLI with `collect` command (+ `capture`/`run` coming soon)
- **Tests** (`test/`): Unit tests and CLI integration tests with fixtures

**Key Principle:** Phases 1-2 (Collect + Capture) are **AI-free** and use deterministic pattern matching. Only Phase 3 (Analyze) uses AI.
